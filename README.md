HTML (index.html)
Structure: The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the game, including:
A title and header that welcomes the player.
Three clickable choices for the player: Rock, Paper, and Scissors, each represented by an image.
A display area for the user's and the computer's win counts.
A result area that shows the outcome of each round (win, lose, or draw).
Links: It links to an external CSS file for styling and a JavaScript file for game functionality.
CSS (rps.css)
Styling: The CSS file styles the game elements to create a visually appealing interface. Key features include:
Centered text and elements with padding and margin resets.
Background colors and hover effects for the choice buttons.
Responsive design elements that adjust based on the viewport size.
Specific styles for the result display and score counters.
JavaScript (rps.js)
Functionality: The JavaScript file implements the game logic:
It keeps track of the user's and the computer's scores.
It generates a random choice for the computer when the user makes a selection.
It determines the outcome of each round (win, lose, or draw) based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
It updates the score display and shows the result message after each round.
Event listeners are added to the choice elements to trigger the game logic when clicked.
Overall Summary
The project is a functional Rock-Paper-Scissors game designed for user interaction through a web browser. Users can play against a computer opponent, with scores tracked and displayed dynamically. The game is built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), making it a good example of a beginner-level web development project. The interface is user-friendly, and the game logic is straightforward, allowing for an engaging experience.
